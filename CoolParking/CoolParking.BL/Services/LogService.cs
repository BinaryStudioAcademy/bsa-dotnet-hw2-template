// TODO: implement the LogService class from the ILogService interface.
//       One explicit requirement - for the read method, if the file is not found, an InvalidOperationException should be thrown
//       Other implementation details are up to you, they just have to match the interface requirements
//       and tests, for example, in LogServiceTests you can find the necessary constructor format.
