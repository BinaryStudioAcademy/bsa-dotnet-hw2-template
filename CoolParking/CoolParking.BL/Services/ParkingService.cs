// TODO: implement the ParkingService class from the IParkingService interface.
//       For try to add a vehicle on full parking InvalidOperationException should be thrown.
//       For try to remove vehicle with a negative balance (debt) InvalidOperationException should be thrown.
//       Other validation rules and constructor format went from tests.
//       Other implementation details are up to you, they just have to match the interface requirements
//       and tests, for example, in ParkingServiceTests you can find the necessary constructor format and validation rules.
